# Database Access Policy
All future database access should use the `get_db()` function from `db.py` to ensure consistent connection management and configuration.

# Testing Policy
All test files should be placed in the `tests/` folder. Use descriptive names like `test_<module>.py` for unit tests and integration tests.
