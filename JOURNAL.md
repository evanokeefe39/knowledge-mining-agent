Timeline of key developments and decisions.

## 2025-10-04
- **RAG Implementation**: Renamed /agent to /agents for multiple implementations. Implemented baseline RAG system with pgvector in Supabase, semantic chunking, and RAGAS evaluation framework.

## 2025-10-04
- **Configuration & Rules**: Improved config parser with dynamic expansion and secret obfuscation. Created AGENTS.md with operational rules. Updated health checks, documentation, and code quality standards.

## Architecture Decisions
- **RAG System**: Chose retrieval-augmented generation for business content analysis
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB for development, Pinecone for production
- **Chunking**: Semantic chunking to preserve business framework coherence
- **Evaluation**: RAGAS framework for comprehensive metrics

## Challenges
- Semantic chunking balance with retrieval precision
- Multi-service configuration management
- Domain-specific evaluation metrics

## Future Plans
- Production vector store implementation
- Synthetic data generation for evaluation
- Domain-specific fine-tuning
- A/B testing framework
