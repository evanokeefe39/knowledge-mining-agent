# Building a Baseline RAG Question-Answer Agent with LangChain: A Complete Implementation and Evaluation Guide

Building an effective RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for Alex Hormozi's business content requires careful attention to both implementation and evaluation. Here's your comprehensive guide to creating a baseline system and measuring its performance.

## RAG System Implementation

Creating a baseline RAG system with LangChain involves several key components that work together to process your enriched Hormozi transcript dataset.

### Basic RAG Architecture

Your RAG system should follow the standard retrieve-then-generate pattern. Start with document preprocessing where you'll chunk your 500 transcript documents into smaller segments. Since you already have summaries and topic modeling enrichment, incorporate this metadata into your chunk structure to improve retrieval precision.[^1][^2]

For the retrieval component, implement a vector store using ChromaDB or Pinecone with your chosen embedding model. The retrieval tool should be wrapped as a LangChain tool that can be called by your agent:[^3]

```python
@tool(response_format="content_and_artifact")
def retrieve_context(query: str):
    """Retrieve information to help answer a query."""
    retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=2)
    serialized = "\n\n".join(
        (f"Source: {doc.metadata}\nContent: {doc.page_content}")
        for doc in retrieved_docs
    )
    return serialized, retrieved_docs
```

Your agent should combine an LLM with this retrieval tool, allowing it to decide when to search for information versus responding directly. This agentic approach is more powerful than naive RAG because it can perform multiple retrievals and reason about the information before generating responses.[^4][^5]

### Data Preprocessing for Business Content

Since you're working with Alex Hormozi's business content, your preprocessing should preserve business-specific context. Create chunks that maintain semantic coherence around business concepts like sales strategies, marketing frameworks, and entrepreneurship principles. Your existing topic modeling enrichment should be incorporated as metadata tags to improve retrieval precision for domain-specific queries.[^6][^7]

Consider implementing semantic chunking rather than fixed-size chunking, as this preserves the logical structure of business advice and frameworks that are central to Hormozi's content. Each chunk should include metadata about the video source, timestamp, topic category, and summary information you've already generated.[^8]

## Evaluation Framework

Comprehensive RAG evaluation requires measuring both retrieval and generation components separately, then assessing their end-to-end interaction.[^9][^10]

### Core Evaluation Metrics

Your evaluation should focus on four primary dimensions using the RAGAS framework:[^11][^3]

**Context Precision** measures how relevant your retrieved documents are to the query. This is critical for business content where irrelevant context can lead to incorrect advice.[^12]

**Context Recall** evaluates whether all relevant information was retrieved. For comprehensive business advice, missing key context can result in incomplete recommendations.[^13]

**Faithfulness** assesses whether generated responses are grounded in the retrieved context, preventing hallucinations that could mislead users about business strategies.[^14]

**Answer Relevancy** measures how well the final response addresses the user's specific question about business topics.[^3]

### Component-Level Testing

Evaluate your retrieval system independently using traditional information retrieval metrics. Test whether your system can correctly identify relevant Hormozi content for different types of business queries - from specific tactical advice to broader strategic frameworks.[^15]

For generation evaluation, use your retrieved context with different prompts and LLMs to understand how well the system transforms business knowledge into actionable advice. This separation helps identify whether poor performance stems from retrieval failures or generation issues.[^16]

### Domain-Specific Considerations

Business content evaluation requires additional considerations beyond standard RAG metrics. Assess whether your system maintains the practical, actionable nature of Hormozi's advice rather than generating generic business content. Evaluate consistency with his specific frameworks and methodologies that appear across multiple transcripts.[^17]

Test your system's ability to handle different query types common in business contexts: tactical questions ("How do I price my product?"), strategic questions ("What's the best marketing channel?"), and comparative questions ("When should I choose X over Y?").[^6]

## Creating Your Evaluation Dataset

Building a high-quality evaluation dataset is crucial for reliable performance measurement.[^18][^12]

### Synthetic Data Generation Approach

Use LLMs to generate diverse question-answer pairs from your Hormozi content. Create questions that span different complexity levels - from simple factual queries to complex multi-step business scenarios that require reasoning across multiple transcripts.[^19][^20]

Generate questions that reflect real user intent patterns for business content. Include tactical implementation questions, strategic decision-making scenarios, and requests for specific frameworks or methodologies that Hormozi discusses.[^21]

### Human Annotation Strategy

While synthetic data provides scale, human-annotated questions ensure real-world relevance. Have business domain experts create questions they would actually ask about entrepreneurship, sales, and marketing. This human input is particularly valuable for complex business scenarios where synthetic generation might miss nuanced requirements.[^18]

Create a diverse question taxonomy covering Hormozi's key topic areas: business acquisition, scaling strategies, marketing funnels, pricing strategies, and team building. Ensure your dataset includes both single-document questions and multi-document questions that require synthesizing information across different videos.[^22]

### Quality Assurance Process

Implement quality checks for your evaluation dataset. Verify that questions have clear, answerable responses in your corpus. Remove questions that are too ambiguous or that require external knowledge not present in the transcripts. Ensure balanced representation across different business topics and complexity levels.[^23]

For each question, manually identify the ground truth context chunks that contain the answer. This enables precise retrieval evaluation and helps identify when your system retrieves relevant but incomplete information.[^18]

## Baseline Performance Measurement

Establish clear baseline metrics before optimization. Measure your initial system performance across all evaluation dimensions to understand current capabilities and identify improvement opportunities.[^16]

Document your baseline's retrieval accuracy, generation quality, and end-to-end performance. This creates a foundation for measuring improvements as you iterate on chunking strategies, embedding models, or generation prompts.

Test your baseline against both your custom evaluation dataset and relevant business domain benchmarks if available. This provides context for how your system performs compared to other business-focused RAG implementations.[^24]

## Production Considerations

Plan for continuous evaluation as your system evolves. Business content and user needs change over time, so implement monitoring for performance drift. Track real user queries and responses to identify areas where your evaluation dataset might not cover actual usage patterns.[^25]

Consider implementing A/B testing frameworks to compare different RAG configurations systematically. This enables data-driven optimization decisions as you enhance your system beyond the baseline implementation.[^16]

Your baseline RAG system provides the foundation for iterative improvement. Focus on creating robust evaluation processes that accurately measure performance across the dimensions most important for business content delivery. This measurement-driven approach ensures your enhancements actually improve user experience rather than just optimizing for vanity metrics.
