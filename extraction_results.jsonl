"strategic focus and investment lead to long-term progress"}}], "text": "This video might save you 20 years of\nyour life or maybe just move your life\n20 years forward. My name is Alex\nRamoszi. I run acquisition.com. It's a\nportfolio of companies that last year\ndid over $250 million in aggreate\nrevenue. And so here's the thing. You\ndon't need to own a company for this to\nwork. You just have to have more dollars\nthan you have time and want to make a\ntrade. Some of the recommendations will\nadd up $20,000 a year. But you can get\nstarted as long as you make over 15\nbucks an hour. And I'm going to show you\nseven investments and the exact order to\ndo them that will save you an entire\nweek every single month. and that's a\nquarter of your life. The first thing is\ngetting your meals taken care of. And so\nwhether you use Uber Eats or you use\npre-made meals, it's about 16 bucks an\nhour in terms of cost to get this done\nfor you. And so if as long as you make\nmore than $16 an hour, you still\narbitrage on your time. And many people\nwho are especially trying to reinvest in\ntheir time, even if you didn't, as long\nas you use that extra time to increase\nyour skill set, it's absolutely worth\nit. So these are all the things just\noutsourcing your meal prepping to gets\nyou back. So number one is groceries. So\nall the time you spend driving to the\nstore, coming back from the store,\nunloading the groceries into your\npantry, all of that time. The next is\nmeal planning, cuz believe it or not,\nyou're think, well, what am I going to\nhave for dinner tonight? And that takes\nmental bandwidth. On top of that, you\nhave, okay, well, if I know what I'm\ngoing to have, I still have to cook it,\nright? And then after you do the\ncooking, what do you do? You got to do\nthe cleaning, right? And then on top of\nthat, you then have to still prep all\nthe food, as in like I have to store it\nand I have to put it away in the fridge\nand I have to portion it out if you're\ngoing to do something like that. And\nwhether you do it at the time you cook\nit or when you eat it, you're still\nportioning it for yourself. And it still\ntakes time and it still takes bandwidth.\nAnd the average American spends 13.5\nhours per week. Huge per week, right?\nThat's two full work days. Think about\nthat, right? 13 and 12 hours a week just\ndoing this stuff. that's not really\nvalue additive. And so right now you can\nget two meals a day, which is what I\nrecommend. Have a shake in the morning,\ndo a lunch and a dinner. Makes it very\neasy. Times 30 days per month. And\nthat's about $750 per month. That sounds\nlike a big ticket, but remember, you're\nnot buying groceries anymore. You're not\nbuying anything else because all of that\nfood is getting delivered. And just\ndon't eat anything besides that. It\nalso, as a side note, is a great way to\nget in shape if you're a little bit\noverweight. Now, I will give you an\nalternative if you're somebody who likes\nto have a little bit more variety.\nThere's a lot of, you know, I would say\nself- finance, whatever, you know, type\npeople, they'll say never eat out and\nall that kind of stuff. I would say just\nmy my life exists as an exact opposite.\nI eat out all the time. And I just see\nthis is as more flexible meal prepping\nthat another business does more\nefficiently than me. And so for a period\nof multiple years, I eat Chipotle twice\na day. And it came out, it was like 500\nplus transactions at Chipotle, uh, that\nmy accountant told me. And he was like,\nI can't believe you're spending so much\nmoney. I was like, but think of how much\ntime I'm saving. And also, I was like,\n\"Look at my grocery bills. They're\nnon-existent.\" Because I only thing I\nwas buying was Red Bull and Coke Zero,\nright? So, if you want to Uber Eats or\nyou want to order and have somebody\ndeliver to you, I think it's totally\nfine. It does cost a little bit more,\nbut net net, it's up to you. So, boom.\n13 and 1/2 hours saved. But we're not\ndone yet. So, this is laundry. And guess\nwhat? The average American spends, do\nyou think it's 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours\na week? That's a half a workday. four\nhours per week doing clothes cleaning\nrelated activities. So that means 30\nminutes a week sorting your actual stuff\nand folding it. Putting it away is like\nan hour plus per week. Washing and\ndrying cycles typically you have to be\nclose to it. That's 2 hours a week. And\nso in total it's 4 hours per week which\nis 16 hours per month. All right. So\nagain, boom, we just found two work days\nright there per month. And so the\nquestion is, okay, well if you can get\ntwo full work days back, you should\ntotally do that. Well, how much does it\ncost? Right. Well, you can do drop off\nservice. Drop off service is usually 1\nand a half to two bucks a pound, right?\nAt least in the US today. All right. And\nso, most people average 30 to 40 lbs a\nmonth. Unless you're crazy and you're\nbig fashion icon. I don't know. I mean,\nI'm obviously a fashion icon, so I know\nall about this, but the monthly cost is\nsomewhere in the neighborhood of $60 to\n$80. Now, you might be wondering like,\nwhy didn't I start with this one rather\nthan the groceries? The thing, the\nreason I like the groceries one is I\nthink it's for many people, they want to\nget in shape better. This can check\nmultiple boxes. Like you can have better\nenergy. You can clear up your skin if\nyou eat too much oily You can lose\nweight and save time. It just like it\nchecks so many boxes up front. It's one\nof the first things I recommend. This\none is small and obvious. Like I have\nnever I've not met many founders who are\nlike, you know what I really look\nforward to? Laundry, right? Like just\nI've never heard it. Some people love\ncooking. Different thing. But as far as\nyour your your your daily drivers in\nterms of activities, not worth it. So,\nthere's a picture of Leila and I\nactually sitting outside of laundromats\nworking on our laptops. We did this\nbecause we were actually moving around\nthe country so often that it was very\ndifficult for us to find like a specific\nlaundroer, I guess you could call it. It\nwas actually just faster. So, as a side\nnote, I actually think that laundromats\ndo make sense, especially if you waste a\nwhole day going from laundry to cleaning\nto dry all day long while you're\nwatching the football game or whatever\nit is. Way better to just go there, get\nit all done, and then be out. And I'll\ngive you the world's smallest tip.\nSmallest tip. If you do choose to wear\nthe same thing every day, it makes it so\neasy to get up and go every morning.\nLike, cuz I have one shelf that just has\nwife beers and then I have a shelf below\nit that has black shorts and I grab one\nfrom here and one from here and I can do\nit in the dark. So, I zero thinking and\nI'm out the door in like 5 seconds. All\nright, so so far we save 13 and 1 half\nhours a week with groceries and we save\nfour hours a week with laundry. So,\nwhat's next? Jesus. Next up is house\ncleaning. So someone to clean your house\nor apartment. Just think bathrooms,\nkitchen, floors, dusting, just kind of\nthe whole place. So this is how much it\nactually saves for you. So on average,\nthe average American spends 3 to 4 hours\ndoing a weekly deep clean and about 30\nminutes per day, which is another 3ish\nhours per week tidying up their home or\ntheir desk or their room or their\nworkspace, whatever. And so in total,\nwe're looking at another six to seven\nhours per week, which gives us 26 hours\nper month. All right. I also, weirdly,\nhave yet to meet an entrepreneur who's\nlike, you know what, I really love just\ndeep cleaning, you know, just putting\nthe putting the gloves on and getting in\nthe shower grate and like picking up the\noven thing or the the stove top and\ngetting in there. I mean, some people\nare crazy, don't get me wrong, and if\nyou love cleaning, then by all means,\nyou can skip this one, but most people\ndon't. And so if you can get yourself\nanother, remember this is 26 hours per\nmonth, three more work days per month\nthat we're adding back to your life. And\nthe total cost is as long as you make\nmore than 20 bucks an hour, it makes\nsense. And so our monthly cost here all\nin. So we had our 60 to 80 here. Here\nwe've got our 200 to 300 per month. And\nthen here we've got our 750 per month.\nAll right. So you can see as we're\nadding this up, we're making progress.\nWe're chipping away. We're buying time\nback. My team just asked me when did I\nstart investing in this? The real real\nanswer is I just didn't clean. And the\nway that I didn't clean is that I just\nwouldn't touch anything in my apartment\nbecause I didn't want anything to get\ndirty so I wouldn't have to clean. So,\nso far we've saved 13 hours a week, 4\nhours a week, and 6 hours a week in\ntotal. So, we're looking at 23ish hours\nper week. And it cost us 750 60 plus\n200. All right. So, all in, we're\nlooking at a,000 bucks a monthish right\nnow for an extra 23 hours per week.\nWe're talking multiple work days per\nweek already. You seeing how this stuff\nadds up? So, let's do the next one.\nBlackout curtains and earplugs. All\nright. Now, I'm telling you, in terms of\nROI, like you spend a third of your life\nsleeping and the idea that so few people\nhave optimized what they spend a third\nof their life in, like you spend so much\non your car, you spend so much on your\nhouse, but a third of your life, right,\nis spent in a bed, it's it is the\ncheapest environment to optimize. I live\nin Vegas and so there's lots of noise\nand so for me I have earplugs that I put\nin and if you ever try doing these the\nfirst like week or so your ears ears\nwill hurt a little bit then you will\n100% adjust and you don't feel it at all\nand now I only sleep with earplugs like\nI can't hear anything and just the the\nocean sound you know when you like put\nit in it's like that sound is now like I\nI just like I'm ready to I'm ready to\npass out. But on top of that, you want\nit to be dark enough that when you open\nyour eyes, you can't notice that your\neyes are open. So you open and it's just\nas black as when you're closed. That's\nwhen you've dark darkened it enough. You\ncan also get electrical tape because\nsometimes there's tiny little lights\nthat you have in your room, just put\nelectrical tape on them. And electrical\ntape doesn't usually rip off paint or\nanything like that. And so those three\nthings like so worth it. Now, if you\nwant to spend a little bit more money, I\nthink it's like about two grand one\ntime, you can get one of those cooling\nmattresses. I strongly recommend it,\nespecially if you live with somebody,\nwell, you sleep with somebody rather. I\nstrongly recommend getting one of those\nsleep mattresses that cools you down. It\nalso will dramatically reduce your\nheating and cooling bill because so we\nhave to we cool our entire house just so\nthat when we're underneath of the the\nblanket, it's a certain temperature, but\nyou can just cool that tiny area and\nit'll save you a ton of money. So, I\nthink net net it'll actually save you\nmoney on your bill, especially if you're\nat work all day or anything like that.\nIf you like sleep masks, you can use\nthose. I would recommend the ones that\nhave the the big cups. I actually do\nboth. So, I have blackout curtains and\nthat like I don't want to see or hear\nanything. You probably already know\nthis, but you probably don't do it,\nwhich is don't watch TV on your phone,\nwhatever, before you go to bed. And as\nsoon as you get one of these mattresses\nthat tracks your sleep, what you'll\nnotice is that you your REM sleep gets\npushed back. And so, one of the things\nis like if you ever feel like, man, I\nfeel like I've got no juice in the\nmiddle of my brain. You know, you get\nthat tired feeling. So, the no juice\nthing is not because you have no juice\nleft. It's actually because you\naccumulated waste in your brain. And so\nyou need your to give your brain time to\nbasically clear the waste out so that it\ncan function properly again. And so\nthat's functionally all we're trying to\ndo here. So how many hours this gets you\nback? I think it's more that it\nincreases the productivity per hour. If\nwe can get another 2 hours of\nproductivity out per day without\nactually creating more time, to me, it's\nstill a net benefit. And again, this is\none of the cheapest ones you can do cuz\nthey're onetime expenses that have\npermanent improvements. And I'm so\nhardcore about this. Like I will buy it\nfor a founder who doesn't have it. And I\nwas like, \"Stop what you're doing right\nnow. Whatever.\" Like, immediately put\nwhatever money you're making out towards\ndoing this. Like, it's a it's a\nnon-starter. It makes no sense for to\nnot get better rest. Like, you live\nlonger. You're in a better mood. You\nmake higher quality decisions. You have\nmore energy. Like, you recover better if\nyou train in your workout. Like, there's\nzero sense to not doing this. All right.\nNext up,\nlandscaping. So, I actually don't assume\nthat you were truly landscaping. You\nprobably use a lawn mower, but that\nwould have been more difficult for me to\ncatch out of thin air. And so we're\ngoing with this thing. As we're moving\nthrough this, we're going up in how much\nit costs, right? One of the things to\nremember is like you only get these\nsavings once. Like I can't go back and\nget this ROI again. Like if right now I\ncould go get myself another 100 hours a\nmonth for 1,500 bucks a month. My god, I\ngo to the Time Store and just buy it\nover and over and over again. I would\njam on the purchase button. You can only\ndo it once, which is why I think it's\none of the highest ROI purchases you can\never make. How much does this normally\ncost people? Well, it normally saves you\n1 to 2 hours per week just for mowing.\nNow, obviously that's seasonal depending\non where you live. The next you've got\nweeds and trimming, which is another 2\nhours. Now, this is per month. All\nright, so this is a little bit less, but\nagain, like as we get further up here,\nyou're going to get less time for more\nfor more money, but that's just the\ntrades you make. You've got gutter\nstuff, gutter cleaning, all right, which\nyou should do cuz otherwise your house\nwill get all messed up if you are into\nthat kind of thing. That's about 4 hours\ntwice a year. And so on average, it's\nabout eight hours per month. And so all\nin you're looking at about $300 per\nmonth to get that time back. Now again,\nyou'll notice that the dollars per hour\ncontinues to go down. But like, welcome\nto becoming more successful. Like you\nhave to spend more. And then once you've\ndone all these ones, it only gets more\nexpensive from there. But these are the\neasiest ones that I get almost all my\ninitial founders to commit to. Now,\nlet's look at the next one. Wo, it's a\ncar. Very small car. And hopefully\nyou're driving a car bigger than this\none. Now, before I get into this, let's\nlook at what you've saved so far. 13 and\na half hours per week for $750 a month.\nYou've got four hours that you're saving\nwith laundry for about 60 bucks a month.\nYou got 6 hours that you're saving with\ncleaning and cleaners for your house.\nThen you've got sleep, which is just\ngoing to get you more hours for all this\nstuff for about 200 bucks a month if you\nfinanced out one of these fancy\nmattresses. And at least the the\nearplugs and the the blackouts are super\ncheap. Then you've got 2 hours a week\nthat you're saving for landscaping and\nmowing and all that kind of jazz. And so\nif we're adding this as we go, which I\nhope you are, it's like we're looking at\n800ish, 1,000ish 1,200ish, 1,500ish per\nmonth. Now, hey, I'm not saying this is\ncheap stuff, but what is it getting you?\nYou're getting in total so far 10 hours,\n23 1/2 hours plus more for that time.\nNow we're at 25 1/2 hours per week.\nThree full work days per week back,\nwhich most people are just wasting their\nweekends on this stuff. What am I doing\nwith this car? All right. So, if now if\nyou make over $50 an hour, you should\nconsider this. So, what is this? So,\nthis is you can either get a driver if\nyou want to be a super baller, right? Or\nyou can just use the virtual driving\neconomy that exists, which is Uber and\nsoon to be Tesla taxis or whatever it\nis, and the driverless fleets that are\ngoing to be there. Cuz I'll bet you\nthat's also going to dramatically\ndecrease the cost of having someone\ndrive you to and from places. It's going\nto approximate the cost of energy. It's\nlike energy plus depreciation on the\ncar. like that's going to really be the\nequation for transport which is amazing\nfor all humans because when you look at\nhow economies work the base the base\nlevel of everything is energy and then\nfrom energy above that you have\ntransportation and so it's a very\nfoundational level of like how efficient\nan economy is and so for you if you\ncould take the 30 minutes a day or 45\nminutes a day that you spend commuting\nwhich by the way the average if you're\ncurious about it is 1 to 2 hours let's\njust call this 1.5 hours per day that\npeople spend and that also Alo doesn't\ninclude the hassle of parking and you\nknow walking from wherever they are at\nto their actual final destination. And\nso believe it or not this is a monster\none. So this is about 30 hours per month\nconservatively that people spend up to\n50 depending on where you live. And so\nthe question is okay that's a lot of\nhours and we said 50 bucks an hour to\nstart this cuz you got to be willing to\nspend a little bit more to get this. So\nin general this is going to probably run\nyou somewhere in the neighborhood of\nlike 600 to a,000 per month. And you're\nlike why is the range so big? Well, it\ndepends how far you drive and how much\nyou drive, right? But it's a pretty\npenny. At the same time though, there's\nalso a lot of hours back. But you might\nbe thinking, well, how do I how do I\nmake those hours productive? That's a\nkey point, right? So, a lot of the\ntweets that you see for my account and\nwhatnot, I actually tweet while I'm I'm\nbeing driven, right? And so, that way\nI'm either checking Slack messages that\nI have so I can update, you know,\nthreads and ASA boards and whatnot. I'm\nkidding. I'm not on a sauna, but like\nwhatever. I'm sure people could do that,\nbut for me, it's it's tweeting and\nchecking Slack to make sure that I can\nmove the ball forward on the projects\nthat I'm involved in. All right, let's\nzoom zoom to the next one. And I'll just\ndraw it for you because this is what\nwe're looking at, which is getting a\nplane. There you go. You don't have to\nbuy a jet. But what you don't know is\nthat you can also just get semi-private\nflying. So, I found out about this way\ntoo late in my life, but you can\nbasically there's plenty of places like\nJSX. I think JetBlue has some of this\nstuff where you can get on a plane with\nlike 20 people. And by doing that, you\nget avoid all of the TSA, all the\nsecurity. You literally just roll up to\nthe plane, walk in, walk out. And as\nsomebody who flies a lot of private, I'm\ntelling you, it's so close to what you\nget in private for such a fraction of\nthe of the price, it's a great deal. And\nso probably somewhere in the\nneighborhood of like triple the cost of\ntravel, but if you compare that to what\nprivate costs, it's way less. So, like\nif for example, if I want to go from\nhere to LA, so I'm in Vegas and that's a\n30 or 45 minute flight, it's still going\nto probably run me 15 grand, maybe 20\nfor that for that flight. There's\nobviously roundtrip, things like that,\nbut let's just use 20 as a as a\nplaceholder. For the same JSX flight,\nit's probably 300 bucks. Now, you could\nget a Spirit or something like that for\nprobably like 50 or 60 if you if you\ntime it right, maybe 99. So, it's going\nto be about triple the cost of one of\nthe kind of commercial airlines, but the\namount of time you save instead of\nhonestly instead of it being a travel\nday, you just work and then you just\ndrive to the place, you get on the\nplane, add 30 minutes, and then you're\nwherever you're at. And so, if you have\nto travel for work, I just like I can't\nrecommend it enough. So, on average, if\nyou fly 50 to 100 hours per year, it's\ngoing to be somewhere around 1 hour per\nweek. And how much does this cost? Well,\nthis is going to cost you significantly\nmore, right? But the thing is is that\nthat one if you travel, if you include\nall the other cost associated with it in\nterms of time, sometimes this can be 10\nhours, right, per week if you travel,\nyou know, a lot. And so this one's super\nvariable, but usually it's going to cost\nyou somewhere in the neighborhood of\na,000 bucks a month on top of what you\nwould normally spend. If we're adding\nall this up and we do this weekly, you\ngot 13 and 1/2, you got 17 and 1/2,\nyou've got 23 and 1/2, you've got more\noptimization. You got 25 and a half,\nyou've got 26, 27, and then you've got 8\non top of that, 35, and then 10 here,\nyou're 45. You basically buy yourself an\nentire week back. Now, if you're like,\nwait, hold on. If I did that, I'd have a\nwhole another work week. Well, the\nanswer is kind of yes. And I'll explain\nwhat I mean. A lot of people want to\nwork all day and they work their\navailable hours per day, but many of\ntheir hours are taken up by what I call\nhumaning, right? Which is doing the\nstuff that you have to do. Like I got to\nfeed this thing and then I got to clean\nthis thing, this bodysuit that I wear,\nright? I got to take it from place to\nplace, right? It's such a pain. So if we\nadd all this up, 750, 60, 200, 200, 300,\n600, 1,000, we're looking at 3,100ish.\nSo three grand a month to get all these\nbenefits. Now, if you're not traveling\nas much, boom, you're at like 2,000ish\nper month. Now, some of you might be\nlike, \"Well, in my market, you'd be\ncrazy to get that.\" It's like, great.\nWell, you probably also earn more cuz\nyou're also in that market. So, chill\nout. All right. The point here is the\nconcept more than the actual dollars and\ncents. And the time is real, right? Now,\nsome of you like, I don't spend that\nmuch time cleaning. Amazing. I love that\nfor you. And for everybody else, find\nuse. All right. But the big picture is\nif we think about focus as the\nhypothetical extreme which is doing\nnothing except for the task that we set\nout to do then anything that is not that\ntask distracts us from the ultimate goal\nthat we have. And so this may seem crazy\nto outsource humaning but unless you get\nsignificant value or purpose or meaning\nfrom doing some of these more mundane\nactivities then I would strongly\nrecommend getting yourself an entire\nweek per week back. And so if you can do\nthat, like I I said at the very\nbeginning of this video, you can get 10\nyears back, but you could probably get a\nlot more than that in terms of\nproductive hours, right? Because you're\nsleeping eight, so you really only have\n16, right? So if all of a sudden you can\nget an extra four, five, six per day\nback because you're not doing all this\nother stuff. All of a sudden people are\nlike, \"How does he get so much done?\"\nIt's like, \"Well, I literally have two\nweeks for every week.\" And this is\naccessible for anybody who has a\nbusiness over a certain level. And you\ndon't have to do it all at once. You\ncould start if we had to make an order\nhere of where I would order these. I did\nit in the order that I would recommend\ndoing it. So, I would do this first. Get\nyour meals and stuff taken care of.\nSecond, get your laundry and stuff taken\ncare of. Then, you've got your cleaning\nfor the house. Get that taken care of.\nNext, this one. I would say make this\nzero. You should for sure do this, but I\ndidn't want to start with sleep because\nit wasn't an hourish thing, but I think\nsuper important. Okay. After that,\nyou've got your your lawn care and all\nthat other jazz. All in, we have seven\nif we include our zero. And so you can\ndo them in this order and they cost this\nmuch and it's one of the highest returns\nyou can get on your time, more than the\nS&P 500. Go spend this money so you can\nincrease your active income rather than\nobsessing over passive and you will\nthink yourself forward in a few years.", "document_id": "doc_9cc9791d"}
